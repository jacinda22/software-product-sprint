      <p>Welcome to my portfolio.</p>
      <p>Hi everyone! My full name is Jacinda Ryzel Soto. Right now you are visiting
        my portfolio page which is kinda cool. I like to code (if that wasn't obvious), read,
        listen to music, paint, and more!</p>
      <p>Here is a funny picture of me.</p>
